The srsRAN software suite is an open-source collection of 4G and 5G software radio implementations from [SRS](https://srs.io). Applications are implemented in portable C++ with minimal third-party dependencies. Licensed under AGPLv3, srsRAN apps run on Linux with off-the-shelf compute and radio hardware.

* The [srsRAN Project](https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_Project) is an ORAN-native 5G CU/DU with a complete stack from I/Q to IP. 
* The [srsRAN 4G](https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_4G) suite provides an end-to-end 4G implementation with full-stack applications for UE, eNodeB and EPC.
